        <p>Ang Lee, born on October 23, 1954, in Taiwan, is a visionary director of our times. With blockbusters like <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>,
         the original <i>Hulk</i>, and <i>Life of Pi</i>, he has cemented himself as a prodigal filmmaker of modern cinema.*</p>
        <p>However, the movies I especially enjoy are the more "indie", "under-the-radar" ones like <i>The Ice Storm</i> and <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> that 
        explore complex themes like identity and family dynamics in the public and private sphere. The latter film won him the Academy Award for Best Director.
        Even though he is an international filmmaker, he has a profound understanding of American culture, which allows him to depict American stories with 
        stunning visuals and innovative camerawork. He has an uncanny way of blending technical skills with emotional depth.</p>

            <h3>Magnum Opus?</h3>
            <p>According to me, Lee's masterpiece is <i>Lust, Caution</i>, an adaption of Eileen Chang's poignant espionage novel set 
            during the Japanese occupation of China. It stars Tang Wei and Tony Leung, novice actors who quickly grew to prominence. 
            Every time I think about this movie, the background score, Wong Chia Chi's Theme, haunts me. Attempting to pigeonhole Lee is 
            an atrocious crime - his work spans multiude of genres and cultures. Even the renowned film critic, Roger Ebert, struggled to 
            find the connection in Lee's filmography:</p>
        </article>

         <blockquote>
            <p>"Failing to find the connecting link between such Ang Lee films as “Sense And Sensibility,” “Brokeback Mountain” and “Hulk,” (2003) 
                I was quickly corrected by readers who said, obviously, all his films are about people trying to realize their essential natures 
                despite the constraints of society. Readers, you were right. " – Roger Ebert</p>
        </blockquote>
